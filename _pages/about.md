Hi, 
I am a fourth-year PhD student at the Technical University of Denmark at the Applied Mathematics and Computer Science Department. I am supervised by [Jes Frellsen](https://frellsen.org/) at DTU and [Wouter Boomsma](https://ku-bioml.github.io/people/#wouter) at DIKU(University of Copenhagen). My research is a part of the [Centre for Basic Machine Learning Research in Life Sciences](https://www.mlls.dk/). 


My recent internship at [SonyAI](https://ai.sony/) with the Music Foundational Model team was fruitful! Interested in non-linear diffusion models, controllability and disentanglement? Read about our work [here](https://uppalanshuk.github.io/files/AU_CVPR_preprint-pages-1.pdf).

Currently, I am in New York collaborating with [Rajesh Ranganath](https://cims.nyu.edu/~rajeshr/) and [Mark Goldstein](https://marikgoldstein.github.io/) at NYU. I am working on effective sampling techniques, controllability and modelling discrete data.

This summer I will be interning at Microsoft in London and will work on generative models.

Prior to starting this graduate program, I was a research associate at <a href="https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/">RBCDSAI, IIT Madras</a> and before that I finished my integrated masters in ECE with a specialisation in signal processing and pattern recognition from <a href='https://iiitb.ac.in/'> IIIT Bangalore</a>. During my masters, in 2019 I also spent some time in the Approximate Bayesian Inference team at <a href='https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/'>RIKEN-AIP</a> in Tokyo working under <a href='https://emtiyaz.github.io/'>Emtiyaz Khan</a> on scaling Bayesian natural gradient optimizers.

# Research Interests 

Lately, I have been focusing on interesting problems in generative modelling. Specifically, I like to think about current challenges with Diffusion Models, like non-linear inference processes, simplifying guidance in pre-trained models, accelerating sampling and modelling discrete data. I also enjoy dabbling in structured modelling and scientific applications of diffusion models. 

I have broad interests in the field of probabilistic modelling. I am enthusiastic about problems in Bayesian deep learning related to uncertainty quantification, variational inference and high-dimensional sampling. More generally, I like pondering about generalisation, distribution shifts and identifiability in deep probabilistic models. I wish I was better at differential geometry, measure theory and high-dimensional sampling. Works that aim to quantify or estimate uncertainty, model densities, or infer underlying structures/phenomena probabilistically, intrigue me.
